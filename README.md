Improving code for accessibility 

In order to maximize the accessibility for a marketing agency's website, I have modified the code that was presented to me. Now the website will be more streamline and easier to navigate. I completed this project to increase maintainability and organization of the code. Using html tags efficiantly and noticing detailes about the code that could be improved are things that I have learned while completing this task.
